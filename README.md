## Routes

1. `POST` Create Shortster

```sh
/shortster
```

- Description

  - Creates a new Shortster object into the system. This route does not requires authentication, but verifies if a JSON web token was provided within the request header. If a token is found, then it will try to extract the user ID from it and assign it to the Shortster object. If no token is found the Shortster will be created with a null value for the `user_id` property. A JSON web token can be created using the create session route.

- Body Params

  - ```JS
    {
      "url": "https://www.google.com",   //required
      "code": "myCustomCode99"   //optional: The user can pick a desired shortster code.
    }
    ```

- Header
  - ```JS
    {
      "authorization": "Bearer ${token_value}",   //required
    }
    ```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node
- NPM
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Torres-ssf/shortster-api
```

2. CD into the project root directory

```sh
cd shortster-api/
```

3. Install npm packages

```sh
yarn
```

4. Set up databases:

  This project uses `Postgres`.

  You will need to have it running into your system:
  - Make a copy of the `ormconfig.example.json` file and rename it to ```ormconfig.json```.
  - Assign values according with the postgres configuration in your system.

  - Setting up PostgreSQL
    ```json
    "port": 5432,
    "username": "postgres username",
    "password": "postgres password",
    "database": "database name",
    ```
    - Assign the port number that was configured in your system to the `port` object (default is `5432`).
    - Assign your postgres username to the `username` object.
    - Assign your postgres password to the `password` object.
    - Create a new postgres database and assign the name to the `database` object.

5. Run migrate command to create all migrations.
```
yarn typeorm migration:run
```

6. This applications uses `jsonwebtokenNow` to grant an access token to logged users.
  - You will need to provide a MD5 hash from an encoded string from your choice. You can generate the hash [here](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/).
  - With the hash in hands, we are ready to setup the environment variables. Make a copy of the `.env.example` to and rename it `.env`.
  - Assign your generated hash to the variable
  ```
  APP_SECRET=generatedMD5HashHere
  ```

### Usage

App Scripts:

```
yarn dev:server
```

- Script for development stage. If all the installation section was properly made, an output message will appear at the terminal: `Server started on port 3333!`

```
yarn build
```

- Script for productions stage.

```
yarn typeorm
```

- Script design to do typeorm task, like creating and revert migrations.

### Run tests

```
yarn test
```
